## What is DKP?

The D2iQ Kubernetes Platform (DKP) makes your operational life easier. Instead of wasting time researching the CNCF landscape for the right tools to solve your enterprise requirements, and struggling with the implementation and lifecycle, you can use a fully curated, integrated, and supported Day 2 ready, out of the box platform.
DKP supported CAPI infrastructures provide an easy to use infrastructure-as-code approach that eliminates the headache around the complexity of the development and lifecycle challenges of Kubernetes. DKP supports the following infrastructure providers out of the box:

* [AKS][capz]
* [AWS][capa]
* [Azure][capz]
* [EKS][capa]
* [GCP][capg]
* Preprovisioned (based on Ansible, requires SSH)
* [VMware vSphere][capv]

For more information about the supported CAPI providers please check out the official DKP documentation: [Advanced configuration][advanced configuration]

Beside the pre-integrated, supported providers, you can bring in any other CAPI provider.
This blog post shows you the needed steps to run DKP on Hetzner Cloud by using the Hetzner CAPI provider.

## What is CAPI?

Kubernetes Cluster API (CAPI) is an official sub project from Kubernetes. The goal of CAPI is to provide a modular framework for deployment and lifecycle management of Kubernetes clusters. At a glance CAPI provides a declarative API and a toolset (for example `clusterctl`) to create and manage Kubernetes clusters as a Kubernetes object.
A big benefit of CAPI is the large number of infrastructure providers (24+). This provider brings in all the required integrations for the infrastructure and handles the infrastructure as code lifecycle. The user does not need to think about infrastructure topics like how virtual machines are provisioned or how to create a NAT gateway. Just define how many control plane and worker nodes, with flavor, with operating system and CAPI will deploy the cluster.

For more information, see the [official CAPI documentation][CAPI docs]

## What is Hetzner?

Outside of Germany / DACH Hetzner is not very popular. Hetzner was founded 1997 in Germany and the portfolio is focused around colocation, bare metal server (as a service) and Hetzner Cloud. Hetzner Cloud provides a very easy to use self service offering around virtual machines (based on KVM), network, (block-) storage, and LoadBalancer. For automation approaches there are cli tools, Terraform modules, and a CAPI provider available.
Since 2021 a datacenter in Ashburn, Virginia is also available to run workload in the United States of America.

For more information, see [Hetzner's website][hetzner].

## Prerequisites / Environment

To start with the deployment of your first cluster at Hetzner Cloud you need the following tools and informations:

* DKP command line tool (version 2.2+)
* Running DKP Enterprise (to attach the Hetzner cluster)
  * [Create Workspace][create workspace docs]
* [kubectl][kubectl] command line tool
* [helm][helm] command line tool
* [clusterctl][clusterctl] command line tool
* [Hetzner][hetzner] account
  * Create a project
  * Upload your SSH public key
  * Generate a readwrite API token for the project

The generated API token will be used for the cluster creation and lifecycle process.

## Deploy Hetzner CAPI provider

Hetzner is not one of DKP's supported CAPI providers so you need to deploy the CAPI provider to your DKP Enterprise management cluster first.
NOTE: Itâ€™s possible to create a fresh local DKP bootstrap cluster and run the same steps there. If you run the steps on a local DKP bootstrap cluster, you will have to move the CAPI components to the deployed cluster later to make it `self managed`.

First, export the kubeconfig for our DKP Enterprise cluster where our CAPI controller is running:

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=./dkp.conf
```

The `clusterctl` command will be used to generate the CAPI provider manifest for Hetzner and apply the generated capi manifest to our DKP Enterprise cluster:

```bash
$ clusterctl generate provider --infrastructure hetzner | \
  kubectl apply -f -

```

Lets verify that your Hetzner CAPI provider is up and running:

```bash
$ kubectl get po -n cluster-api-provider-hetzner-system
NAME                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
caph-controller-manager-7576dcbf56-wd9tc   1/1     Running   0          44s
```

All information around Hetzner CAPI provider can be found on the [official github page][hetzner capi].

## Deploy cluster

The Hetzner CAPI controller manager is up and running so the Hetzner based cluster can be deployed. The first steps are exporting all required environment variables to configure the template.

```bash
export HCLOUD_TOKEN="<Hetzner rw api token>"
export HCLOUD_SSH_KEY="<SSH key name>"
export CLUSTER_NAME="hetznerdemo"
export HCLOUD_REGION="fsn1"
export CONTROL_PLANE_MACHINE_COUNT=3
export WORKER_MACHINE_COUNT=3
export KUBERNETES_VERSION=1.23.7
export HCLOUD_CONTROL_PLANE_MACHINE_TYPE=cpx31
export HCLOUD_WORKER_MACHINE_TYPE=cpx31
export CLUSTER_NAMESPACE=hetzner-7wrqw-5t2tp
```

Please be sure that all exported variables are valid. The `HCLOUD_SSH_KEY` name must match with the name you set during the upload via Hetzner CLI / UI. The Kubernetes version must fit the supported K8s version range from DKP.
See [DKP release notes][DKP release notes] to validate which Kubernetes versions are supported.

These environment variables define that a cluster with 3 control-planes with `cpx31` flavor and 3 workers with `cpx31` flavor in region `fsn1` will be created. Your SSH key can be used to login as user `root`.
A default Ubuntu 20.04 is used as a base image, but it is recommended to use your own base image if you run clusters in production!

The variable `CLUSTER_NAME` defines the namespace of the DKP workspace where the cluster should be created. Please note that workspace name and namespace name can be different. You can get both via the `dkp` CLI:

```bash
$ dkp get workspace
NAME                NAMESPACE
default-workspace   kommander-default-workspace
hetzner-7wrqw       hetzner-7wrqw-5t2tp
kommander-workspace kommander
```

CAPI credentials are stored as a secret. The following commands generate a secret to store the HCLOUD_TOKEN in the defined namespace and set the `move` flag. This flag is needed if CAPI components needs to move from the bootstrap cluster to another cluster. This step is absolutely necessary if you run CAPI on local bootstrap cluster (via `dkp create bootstrap`).

```bash
$ kubectl create secret generic hcloud-token-${CLUSTER_NAME} \
    --from-literal=hcloud=${HCLOUD_TOKEN} -n ${CLUSTER_NAMESPACE}

secret/hcloud-token-hetznerdemo created

$ kubectl label secret hcloud-token-${CLUSTER_NAME} \
    -n ${CLUSTER_NAMESPACE} \
    clusterctl.cluster.x-k8s.io/move=""

secret/hcloud-token-hetznerdemo labeled
```

After all variables are set correctly and the secret is created, the `clusterctl` command can be used to create the Hetzner cluster manifest.

```bash
clusterctl generate cluster --infrastructure hetzner:v1.0.0-beta.0 \
    ${CLUSTER_NAME} -n ${CLUSTER_NAMESPACE} > ${CLUSTER_NAME}.yaml
```

The default configuration of the Hetzner CAPI provider uses the same secret name `hetzner` for every cluster. This could be problematic if there is the need to deploy multiple clusters placed in different Hetzner projects in the same workspace. One solution is to used a dedicated secret per cluster, in this case a secret with the name `hcloud-token-${CLUSTER_NAME}`.
If you use dedicated secret names, you need to patch the generated cluster manifest to set the individual token secret name.

```bash
$ cat ${CLUSTER_NAME}.yaml
...
---
apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: HetznerCluster
metadata:
  name: hetznerdemo
  namespace: hetzner-7wrqw-5t2tp
spec:
  controlPlaneEndpoint:
    host: ""
    port: 443
  controlPlaneLoadBalancer:
    region: fsn1
  controlPlaneRegions:
  - fsn1
  hcloudNetwork:
    enabled: false
  hcloudPlacementGroups:
  - name: control-plane
    type: spread
  - name: md-0
    type: spread
  hetznerSecretRef:
    key:
      hcloudToken: hcloud
    name: hetzner
  sshKeys:
    hcloud:
    - name: demo
---
```

Replace the secret name `hetzner` with our cluster name secret `hcloud-token-${CLUSTER_NAME}`. In my case it looks like this:

```bash
$ echo hcloud-token-${CLUSTER_NAME}

hcloud-token-hetznerdemo

$ cat ${CLUSTER_NAME}.yaml
...
---
apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: HetznerCluster
metadata:
  name: hetznerdemo
  namespace: hetzner-7wrqw-5t2tp
spec:
  controlPlaneEndpoint:
    host: ""
    port: 443
  controlPlaneLoadBalancer:
    region: fsn1
  controlPlaneRegions:
  - fsn1
  hcloudNetwork:
    enabled: false
  hcloudPlacementGroups:
  - name: control-plane
    type: spread
  - name: md-0
    type: spread
  hetznerSecretRef:
    key:
      hcloudToken: hcloud
    name: hcloud-token-hetznerdemo
  sshKeys:
    hcloud:
    - name: demo
---
```

Now you can deploy the manifest.

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f ${CLUSTER_NAME}.yaml

kubeadmconfigtemplate.bootstrap.cluster.x-k8s.io/hetznerdemo-md-0 created
cluster.cluster.x-k8s.io/hetznerdemo created
machinedeployment.cluster.x-k8s.io/hetznerdemo-md-0 created
machinehealthcheck.cluster.x-k8s.io/hetznerdemo-control-plane-unhealthy-5m created
machinehealthcheck.cluster.x-k8s.io/hetznerdemo-md-0-unhealthy-5m created
kubeadmcontrolplane.controlplane.cluster.x-k8s.io/hetznerdemo-control-plane created
hcloudmachinetemplate.infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/hetznerdemo-control-plane created
hcloudmachinetemplate.infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/hetznerdemo-md-0 created
hetznercluster.infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/hetznerdemo created
```

To see the current status you can describe the cluster via the dkp command line tool.

```bash
$ dkp describe cluster -n ${CLUSTER_NAMESPACE} -c ${CLUSTER_NAME}
NAME                                                                         READY  SEVERITY  REASON                           SINCE  MESSAGE

```

After the first control plane node (in this example hetznerdemo-control-plane-h5k5n) is in ready state `true`, you can get the kubeconfig of our newly created cluster and deploy the needed components CNI, CCM, and CSI. The components CNI and CCM are mandatory.

The `kubeconfig` of the created cluster is stored as secret in the workspace namespace. You can use the `kubectl` command line tool to download the kubeconfig and save to our local filesystem.

```bash
$ kubectl get secret -n ${CLUSTER_NAMESPACE} ${CLUSTER_NAME}-kubeconfig \
    -o jsonpath='{.data.value}'|base64 -d> ${CLUSTER_NAME}.kubeconfig
```

Youâ€™ll use this kubeconfig file to communicate directly with the newly created cluster.

### Deploy CNI

Kubernetes needs a Container Network Interface (CNI) compliant software defined network to be ready for usage. DKP uses [Calico][calico] by default so you'll deploy Calico to the new deployed cluster. Calico provides multiple deployment methods. In this case you're using the Helm deployment of `TigeraOperator`.
You can read more at [Calico quickstart][calico quickstart].

```bash
$ helm repo add projectcalico https://projectcalico.docs.tigera.io/charts

"projectcalico" has been added to your repositories

$ helm upgrade --install calico projectcalico/tigera-operator \
    --version v3.24.1 \
    --namespace tigera-operator \
    --kubeconfig ${CLUSTER_NAME}.kubeconfig \
    --create-namespace

NAME: calico
LAST DEPLOYED: Mon Aug 29 14:10:32 2022
NAMESPACE: tigera-operator
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
```

Please be sure that your `helm upgrade` command uses the kubeconfig file of the target cluster. Otherwise, you could damage your DKP Enterprise cluster.

Validate the running pods after the helm chart was successfully.

```bash
$ kubectl get po -A --kubeconfig ${CLUSTER_NAME}.kubeconfig |grep calico

calico-system     calico-kube-controllers-7d6749878f-6nxlv                  0/1     Pending   0          26s
calico-system     calico-node-lrpdm                                         0/1     Running   0          26s
calico-system     calico-typha-6ccd5d454d-r4mls                             1/1     Running   0          26s
```

### Deploy CCM

Hetzner Cloud requires a Cloud Controller Manager (CCM) to work specifically with Hetzner. This Hetzner CCM is also available via Helm and will be deployed like the CNI solution.

```bash
$ helm repo add syself https://charts.syself.com

"syself" has been added to your repositories

$ helm upgrade --install ccm syself/ccm-hcloud \
    --version 1.0.10 \
    --namespace kube-system \
    --kubeconfig ${CLUSTER_NAME}.kubeconfig \
    --set secret.name=hcloud-token-${CLUSTER_NAME} \
    --set secret.tokenKeyName=hcloud \
    --set privateNetwork.enabled=false

Release "ccm" does not exist. Installing it now.
NAME: ccm
LAST DEPLOYED: Mon Aug 29 14:15:58 2022
NAMESPACE: kube-system
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
```

Validate the running pods after the helm chart was successfully updated.

```bash
$ kubectl get pods -n kube-system --kubeconfig ${CLUSTER_NAME}.kubeconfig |grep ccm

ccm-ccm-hcloud-85d598f8b7-zptfl          1/1     Running   1 (8m38s ago)   10m
```

### Deploy CSI (optional)

Hetzner provides a Container Storage Interface (CSI) for the block storage backend of Hetzner Cloud. If your application needs storage it makes sense to deploy the CSI plugin to easily consume block storage via Kubernetes StorageClass.

The deployment is also available via Helm chart. You need to create a overrides values yaml to define the StorageClass and inject this configuration during the `helm upgrade` process:

```bash
$ cat << EOF > csi-values.yaml
storageClasses:
- name: hcloud-volumes
  defaultStorageClass: true
  reclaimPolicy: Retain
EOF

$ KUBECONFIG=${CLUSTER_NAME}.kubeconfig helm upgrade --install \
    csi syself/csi-hcloud \
    --version 0.2.0 \
    --set secret.name=hcloud-token-${CLUSTER_NAME} \
    --set secret.tokenKeyName=hcloud \
    --namespace kube-system \
    -f csi-values.yaml

Release "csi" does not exist. Installing it now.
NAME: csi
LAST DEPLOYED: Mon Aug 29 14:20:33 2022
NAMESPACE: kube-system
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
```

Validate that the StorageClass is created.

```bash
$ kubectl get sc --kubeconfig ${CLUSTER_NAME}.kubeconfig

NAME                       PROVISIONER         RECLAIMPOLICY   VOLUMEBINDINGMODE      ALLOWVOLUMEEXPANSION   AGE
hcloud-volumes (default)   csi.hetzner.cloud   Retain          WaitForFirstConsumer   true                    1m
```

## Verify cluster

After CSI and CCM are deployed correctly CAPI continues with the deployment of all master and worker nodes. After a few minutes our cluster should be deployed and all nodes are in state `Ready`.
You can verify this via `dkp` and `kubectl` cli:

```bash
$ dkp describe cluster -n ${CLUSTER_NAMESPACE} -c ${CLUSTER_NAME}

NAME                                                                         READY  SEVERITY  REASON  SINCE  MESSAGE

```

## Attach cluster to DKP Enterprise

At this stage, CAPI successfully deployed the cluster and the CAPI controller running at the DKP Enterprise management cluster is handling the lifecycle.

In DKP you see the cluster in state `unattached`:
![Unattached cluster in DKP Enterprise](unattached.png)

Thatâ€™s why the cluster object is created in the workspace so Kommander detects this cluster but itâ€™s not managed by Kommander / DKP Enterprise right now. To change this you need to apply the missing KommanderCluster object.

```bash
$ cat << EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: kommander.mesosphere.io/v1beta1
kind: KommanderCluster

```

This object tells Kommander / DKP Enterprise that the new cluster should be handled as an attached cluster.
After a few seconds, the cluster shows up as `Active` and DKP starts to deploy Flux and the workspace namespace to the target cluster. You can validate this via UI and cli:
![Attached cluster in DKP Enterprise](attached.png)

```bash
$ kubectl get ns --kubeconfig ${CLUSTER_NAME}.kubeconfig

NAME                     STATUS   AGE
cert-manager             Active   61s
default                  Active   44m
hetzner-7wrqw-5t2tp      Active   71s
kommander-flux           Active   91s
kube-federation-system   Active   98s
kube-node-lease          Active   44m
kube-public              Active   44m
kube-system              Active   44m
```

All pre enabled applications from the Application Catalog (like Traefik) will be deployed to the target cluster now.

## Get Traefik up and running

For Traefik we need to set an additional service label. Otherwise, Kubernetes is not able to create the external LoadBalancer.
Please set the following settings to our Traefik deployment (via DKP Enterprise UI or cli):

```yaml
service:
  annotations:
    load-balancer.hetzner.cloud/location: "<REGION>"
```

`REGION` must match with the REGION defined in environment variable `HCLOUD_REGION`

## Recap

DKP Enterprise is a multi-cloud management platform which is built on state of the art technologies like Kubernetes and Cluster API. D2iQ ships 7 CAPI providers out-of-the-box as part of the DKP product.
This guide showed how easy the integration of additional CAPI providers is. You have the possibility to implement additional CAPI providers to DKP, deploy clusters, and use the standardized toolset for Enterprise grade day 2 operation on all of your CAPI valid Kubernetes clusters.

The deployment of CAPI providers and clusters is declarative and based on YAML manifests, so itâ€™s the perfect baseline to implement a GitOps approach.
